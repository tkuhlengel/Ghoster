# Ghoster2
A significant revision of Ghoster, one of Skrommel's  http://www.dcmembers.com/skrommel/download/ghoster/

The purpose of this fork is to improve on Ghoster's Multi-monitor funcionality, and improve some of the bugs it experiences.

I took it upon myself to fix this useful tool, as no other free option met my needs.  It remains a simple tool, now with fewer behavioral bugs.

# Keyboard Shortcuts
Ctrl+Shift+Q Exits the program.

Ctrl+Shift+` (backtick/tilde) Temporarily disables/enables the darkening effect.

Ctrl+Shift+I Shows information about the window under the mouse.  This was more for me, and can be disabled for anyone else on request.

# Known Issues:
  1. Right clicking/opening a menu before a window is activated will put the menu behind the newly-activated window.  Temporary Solution: Left click the window to bring it to the front before opening any menus or popups.
  2. ShowOnTop option does not work as intended.  Leave ini setting to 0.
  3. Loading Images as the background is untested, and not a feature I'm terribly interested in.  Pull requests may be accepted.
